# AlmaPoC-WebHeroes

## Introduction
Welcome to the Web Heroes project repository! This project aims to enhance the authentication system of our Web Heroes application by integrating PHP and REST API to handle access requests and secure sensitive web pages.

## Project Details
### Part 1: Login Page and Welcome Page
The initial phase of the project focused on developing a user-friendly login page and a welcoming dashboard.

### Part 2: Authentication System Enhancement
Now, the project's focus shifts to improving the existing authentication system by integrating REST API to manage access requests. This update aims to make the system more robust, scalable, and compliant with development best practices.

## Tasks
### Development of REST API:
- Create a set of REST API to handle authentication operations, including user credential validation.
- Utilize the POST method to manage API access requests.

### Integration of REST API into the Login Page:
- Modify the login page (`login.php`) to send credentials through a POST request to the developed REST API.

### Handling REST API Responses:
- In the PHP logic of the login page (`login.php`), manage the response received from the REST API and authenticate the user accordingly.

### Protection of the Protected Page:
- Ensure that the protected page (`protected.php`) continues to secure its content by requiring authentication through the integrated REST API.
