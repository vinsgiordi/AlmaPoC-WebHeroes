# AlmaPoC-WebHeroes

Welcome to the Web Heroes project repository! This project is a short in progress assigned to me by my team leader to test and improve my skills. It aims to develop a robust login page and a friendly dashboard for our Web Heroes application. These pages serve as initial contact points for users and play a key role in improving the overall user experience.
